Example 1
---

If the work is a derivative of the original work, the header might look like this:

|  Attached work is attributed to: (author name)
|
|  License was applied by (name), with authorization from the original author.
|
|  Work modified by: (second author)

However if the work is a derivative of a derivative, then the header might look like this:

|  Attached work is attributed to: (author name)
|
|  License was applied by (name), with authorization from the original author.
|
|  Work modified by: (second author)
|  Work modified by: (third author)

Keep adding lines, as new contributors pick up the work. The names should be in chronological order, so be sure to add new contributors to the bottom.

If multiple people are working on a specific derivative at one time, their names should be on the same line. DO NOT make new header lines for individuals within a group.
